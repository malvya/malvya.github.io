I am a well-rounded international development professional, economist and an avid evaluator with extensive experience in managing impact evaluations, building capacity towards handling large sets of mixed methods data and verifying computational reproducibility of conducted evaluations. I am also skilled in several tools (statistical and others) such as STATA, R, SAS, SPSS, LATEX, Epi Info, ArcGIS, GeoDa, SurveyCTO, GitHub and so on. I have played a key role in leading 3ie’s Research Transparency Initiative, managing 3ie’s Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations (RIDIE) and 3ie’s Public Data repository on Harvard Dataverse. I have supervised production and verification of impact evaluation data and advised research personnel on improving the quality, reproducibility and management of such data and analysis code. I am an innovative researcher and an experienced teacher.  

Apart from the mentioned skills, I am highly informed in conducting field work in remote and hard to reach locations in rural India. I have led and conducted mixed methods research activities including data collection across areas in Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and West Bengal. I have experience with working on hands on research projects with national and international organizations such as American Institutes for Research, Tshuda University, The University of Chicago and so on. Previously, I have taught courses such as Undergraduate Micro and Macroeconomics, Intermediate econometrics, Graduate Econometrics and Labor economics. 

I am open to interdisciplinary research collaborations, innovative projects around social big data, data visualizations and international development research. 

In my leisure time, I am an avid traveller, rock climber, and cook. Currently, over the weekends I can be mostly found researching new recipes and binge watching travel and rock climbing related TV shows.
