Transparency and Openness of Impact Evaluations in International Development: An Audit of 3ie-Funded Research <br>with [Sean Grant](https://fsph.iupui.edu/about/directory/grant-sean.html)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
In this paper we plan to investigate the degree to which 3ie-funded impact evaluations report use of open science practices—and among those that do, the degree of transparency of these reported practices. It will begin with a survey on the use of open science practices among all 3ie-funded impact evaluations, followed by in-depth audits on the transparency of open science practices implemented by research teams of 3ie-funded impact evaluations. Given the recent 3ie policy mandating pre-analysis plan (PAPs), the first in-depth audit will focus on the transparency of information reported in PAPs of 3ie-funded impact evaluations. Dependent on interest and resources, this PAP audit will be followed by more in-depth audits of study registrations and final reports.

Power in practice <br>with Robert Reed, Alex Tian, Tom Coupe, Ben Wood

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Statistical power is the probability of obtaining a significant estimate, conditional on the true size of the underlying effect. Research funders commonly ask for ex-ante power calculations to determine whether the sample size of the proposed research is sufficient to demonstrate an effect. However, ex-ante power calculations often involve subjective judgments. The purpose of our study is to present a simple estimator of power that can be used after a study is completed. We first provide Monte Carlo evidence of the reliability of this estimator. We then apply it to a set of studies that were funded by 3ie (International Initiative for Impact Evaluation). We compare our ex post calculations of power with the ex-ante calculations that were submitted to the funder. Finally, we discuss how ex post power calculations can be useful in a number of settings, including current debates in the “replication crisis”.
