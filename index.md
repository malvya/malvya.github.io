title: Hi, I'm Malvya
subtitle: PhD student, Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon

---

I am a PhD scholar and a Graduate Teaching Fellow with the Department of Anthropology at the University of Oregon. My doctoral research aims to investigate what ‘development’ or ‘progress’ means to backward caste communities in India. I conduct mixed-methods research using participatory research elements and evaluation theories in two diverse regions in India (one in the North and one in the South) which are inhabited by unique ethnic groups. I am working towards a comparative analysis of backward caste communities with a strong focus on gender inequality, gender based violence, notions of development and community based interventions. I also explore how social networks can aid in developing an understanding of how complex human communities function. This research draws parallels from marginalized and low income communities in Asia and Latin America.

Prior to embarking on my doctoral studies, I have worked as an international development professional and researcher with national and international for-profit and nonprofit organizations. My background is in Monitoring-Evaluation-Learning (MEL), participatory research, advocacy and programme development. I am excited to learn of community led interventions, gender-related research, behaviour change measurements and trends in International and rural development research/evaluation.
